creating a Windows file server, setting up a file share, and then mounting the file share on a CentOS server:
- Install File Server Role (if not installed):
Go to Server Manager > Add Roles and Features.
Select the File and Storage Services role.
Complete the installation process.

- Create a File Share:
Open File Explorer and navigate to a folder (e.g., D:\SharedFiles).
Right-click the folder and select Properties.
Go to the Sharing tab and click Advanced Sharing.
Enable Share this folder and give it a name (e.g., SharedFiles).
Click Permissions, add or adjust users/groups (e.g., Everyone), and set permissions as needed (Read/Write/Full Control).

- Check Network Sharing Settings:
Go to Control Panel > Network and Sharing Center > Advanced Sharing Settings.
Ensure File and printer sharing is enabled.
Ensure the Password-protected sharing setting matches your desired access configuration

- Install Required Packages on CentOS
sudo yum install cifs-utils -y
- Create a Mount Point:
sudo mkdir /mnt/windows_share
- Mount share
sudo mount -t cifs -o username=Administrator,password=Password //192.168.8.145/Share /mnt/windows_share
If share name has spaces escape characters. e.g : File Share
sudo mount -t cifs -o username=Administrator,password=Password //192.168.8.145/File\ Share /mnt/windows_share

- Persistent mount and udev, nofail option
vi /etc/fstab
//192.168.8.145/Share /mnt/windows_share cifs username=Administrator,password=Blackninja@123456,uid=1000,gid=1000,_netdev,nofail 0 0
