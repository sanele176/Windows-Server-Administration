     Go to Information > Overview
     Find "iLO Firmware Version"
   Method 2: Check via SSH or Command Line
     SSH into the iLO interface:
     ssh Administrator@<ILO-IP-Address>
     Run:
     show /map1 firmware
     Note the current version.

- Step 2: Download the Latest iLO Firmware
  Visit the HP Support Page:
  Link: https://support.hpe.com
  Search for your server model (e.g., ProLiant DL380 Gen10).
  Navigate to Drivers & Firmware.
  Download the latest iLO 5 firmware (.bin or .rpm file).

- Step 3: Upgrade iLO Firmware
  Method 1: Upgrade via iLO Web Interface (Easiest)
